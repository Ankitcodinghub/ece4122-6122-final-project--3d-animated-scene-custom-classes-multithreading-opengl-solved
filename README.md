Write a C++ application that uses a custom class(es) with OpenGL and a third-party library (i.e. ASSIMP) to load and display animated 3D objects in OBJ files. Your program should load and render the objects in the 3D screen. The animated 3D objects are frozen in place until the user presses the ‚Äúg‚Äù key and then the objects start moving around at random speeds and rotating randomly about an axis. You must have at least four animated 3D objects and each object‚Äôs movements are calculated in a separate thread. The objects must be able to collide and bounce off each other. The objects should also be confined to the space around the center of the scene and cannot just float off into space. You are free to use your own objects if you prefer.

1. (30 pts) Create an oversized floor with a textured image. There is one provided but you are free to use your own images.

2. (30 pts) The four objects are rendered correctly with lighting and material properties. Have some general ambient and diffuse lighting effects.

3. (50 pts) The four objects do not move and only start to move when the user presses the ‚Äúg‚Äù key.

4. (40 pts) The four objects start to move and rotate randomly around the area. The object shall collide and bounce off each other and the floor.

5. (30 pts) Each of the four 3D objects has an internal light that randomly changes intensity.

6. (30 pts) The camera view should always point towards the center of the scene.

7. (30 pts) Pressing the up/down arrow keys should zoom in and out.

8. (30 pts) Pressing the left/right arrow keys rotate either the camera view or the model left and right.

9. (30 pts) Pressing the ‚Äúu‚Äù and ‚Äúd‚Äù keys causes the camera to rotate up or down. Pressing escape key ends the application.

Add extra static objects to give the scene depth. Be careful not to add too many or it will slow down your application.

Turn-in Instructions:

Two methods:

1.

a. Upload a video of your application running and demonstrate the requirements above.

b. Put all the code files you created into a zip file called FinalProject.zip and upload to canvas.

2.

b. You can use the tutorial09_Assimp example from class to develop your code. Place your new source code files in a subfolder called code. Once you have finished your development, zip the tutorial09_Assimp folder with your changes into a zip file called FinalProject.zip and upload to canvas.

Grading Rubric

AUTOMATIC GRADING POINT DEDUCTIONS PER PROBLEM:

Element Percentage Deduction Details

Does Not Compile 30% Code does not compile on PACE-ICE!

Does Not Match Output Up to 100% The code compiles but does not produce the correct outputs. See point values above.

Clear Self-Documenting Coding Styles 10%-25% This can include incorrect indentation, using unclear variable names, unclear/missing comments, or compiling with warnings. (See Appendix A)

Appendix A: Coding Standards

Indentation:

When using if/for/while statements, make sure you indent 4 spaces for the content inside those. Also make sure that you use spaces to make the code more readable. For example:

for (int i; i &lt; 10; i++)

{ j = j + i;

}

If you have nested statements, you should use multiple indentions. Each { should be on its own line (like the for loop) If you have else or else if statements after your if statement, they should be on their own line.

for (int i; i &lt; 10; i++)

{

if (i &lt; 5) { counter++; k -= i; } else

{ k +=1; } j += i;

}

Camel Case:

This naming convention has the first letter of the variable be lower case, and the first letter in each new word be capitalized (e.g. firstSecondThird). This applies for functions and member functions as well! The main exception to this is class names, where the first letter should also be capitalized.

Variable and Function Names:

Your variable and function names should be clear about what that variable or function is. Do not use one letter variables, but use abbreviations when it is appropriate (for example: ‚Äúimag‚Äù instead of

‚Äúimaginary‚Äù). The more descriptive your variable and function names are, the more readable your code will be. This is the idea behind self-documenting code.

File Headers:

Every file should have the following header at the top

/*

Author: your name

Class: ECE4122 or ECE6122 (section)

Description:

What is the purpose of this file?

*/ Code Comments:

1. Every function must have a comment section describing the purpose of the function, the input and output parameters, the return value (if any).

2. Every class must have a comment section to describe the purpose of the class.

3. Comments need to be placed inside of functions/loops to assist in the understanding of the flow of the code.
